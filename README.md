# Kontrol

[**Kontrol**](https://github.com/runtimeverification/kontrol) is a powerful formal verification tool for EVM smart contracts that makes complex verification easy. Kontrol supports Foundry tests as specifications, which is especially useful for those who are not verification engineers. Additionally, developers can leverage existing Foundry test suites to do formal verification and increase the level of confidence.


- **Open Source**: Kontrol is open source under the [BSD-3 Clause License](https://github.com/runtimeverification/kontrol/blob/master/LICENSE). This gives you full kontrol to use, modify, and redistribute it according to your needs.
- **User Friendly**: Kontrol gives you the advantage of using languages and testing frameworks youâ€™re already familiar with. Kontrol enables developers to write formal specifications as [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) tests in [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org). In addition, this allows developers to reuse their existing test suites for formal verification.
- **Scalable**: Kontrol automatically verifies your contracts against your formal specifications via compositional symbolic execution. It generates proofs during the verification process, allowing you to verify contracts of any size. Additionally, Kontrol enhances efficiency by supporting lemmas, loop invariants, and bounded model checking.
- **Trustworthy**: Kontrol has a trustworthy mathematical foundation for specifying and verifying smart contracts. It is built on the open-source, validated, and intuitive formal semantics of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode, [KEVM](https://github.com/runtimeverification/evm-semantics). This provides an additional guarantee that the smart contracts you have verified will demonstrate the exact same behavior when executed by the virtual machine.

- **CI Integrated**: In addition to running locally, Kontrol can be integrated into your project's CI for continuous assurance, cloud-based verification, and visualization capabilities via [KaaS](https://docs.runtimeverification.com/kaas).
