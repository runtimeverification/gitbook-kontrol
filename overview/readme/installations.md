### Prerequisites Installing Nix

To install [nix](https://nixos.org) you can use:

#### Linux 

[Install Nix using the Determinate Systems Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer#usage) with the default planner and options:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

#### macOS

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install macos --extra-conf "trusted-users = $(whoami)"
```

### Installing Kontrol <a href="#h.c2tiycvv94xz" id="h.c2tiycvv94xz"></a>

The simplest way to install **Kontrol** is with the `kup`[ ](https://github.com/runtimeverification/kup)[package manager](https://github.com/runtimeverification/kup). To install `kup` execute the following command:

```
bash <(curl https://kframework.org/install)
```

After installing `kup`, install **Kontrol** using `kup` with the following command:

```
kup install kontrol
```


{% hint style="info" %}
The first installation of `kup` will take sometime. Check out the [kup-cheatsheet.md](../../cheatsheets/kup-cheatsheet.md "mention") for some additional information!

For detailed instructions on building **Kontrol** from source, go to the [**Kontrol** repository](https://github.com/runtimeverification/kontrol).
